            <h1>Brexit Timeline</h1>

            <p class="lead">
                Brexit has happened and the UK is now outside the transition period. It is now time to see if the
                promises of Brexit are true.
            </p>
            <p>
                The news cycle is also bery busy, pushing important Brexit stories of the front covers of papers and
                allowing the government to escape accountability. By creating a timeline of stories
                we hope to make it easy for the public to see and follow the unfolding problems of Brexit.
